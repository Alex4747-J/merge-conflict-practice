# merge-conflict-practice
This is our merge conflict practice for today's lesson in Multi-Auth.

This again is our merge-practice thingy, this thing is much needed for coder and developer purly for the reason of collaborating.

You can feel this is necessary through every class, and as we get more and more into coding, colaborating is much needed in every way.
Or not, you can accept defeat and retreat to your own comfort zone.

Merge conflict is needed mostly for when collaborators working on the same file, while in different branches, to avoid merge conflict, each dev should be working in other file for the same folder/projects.
